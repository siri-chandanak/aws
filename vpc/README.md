# Virtual Private Cloud  

A **VPC** is a private, isolated network you create within a cloud provider’s infrastructure — in AWS, it’s your own customizable section of the AWS network.  

### Why VPC?  
1. Your resources are protected from other AWS customers.  
2. Full control over IP ranges, routing, and access.  
3. Can expand with more subnets, gateways
